### ðŸ’¯ Custom component that encapsulates styling

Try to make a custom `<Box />` component that renders a div and accepts a `size`
prop rather than a className and also merges the `style` prop and `className`
props as well.

I should be able to use it like so:

```jsx
<Box size="small" style={{backgroundColor: 'lightblue'}}>
  small lightblue box
</Box>
```
