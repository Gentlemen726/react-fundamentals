# 01 - Context

## Background

React's context API is a fundamentally critical part to any sizeable React
Application. The API itself is quite simple:

```javascript
import React from 'react'

const Foo = React.createContext()

function FooValue() {
  const fooContextValue = React.useContext(Foo)
  return <div>{fooContextValue}</div>
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Foo.Provider value="hello">
    <FooValue />
  </Foo.Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
)

// this renders: <div>hello</div>
```

The idea here is that you can implicitly pass state around a branch of your
React component tree (or the entire tree as in the example above) without having
to manually pass that state around via props.

## Exercise

There are some good ways to use the React context API to improve the
maintainability of your app and that's what this exercise is all about. In this
exercise, we're going to imagine we have a user settings page where we render a
form for the user's information. We'll be storing the user's information in
context and we'll follow some patterns for exposing ways to keep that context
updated as well as interacting with the backend.

> ðŸ’° In this exercise, if you enter the text "fail" in the tagline or biography
> input, then the "backend" will reject the promise so you can test the error
> case.

The form is all written out for you in the Usage example. Your job will be to
implement the context module which exports a `UserProvider` component and a
`updateUser` helper function.

> ðŸ¦‰ To keep things simple we're leaving everything in one file, but normally
> you'll put the context in a separate module.

From here you should be good to go to follow the instructions from the emoji.
Note that there are a few ways to accomplish this one and feel free to
experiment a bit. It'll help your learning and retention to struggle with this.

> That's how we'll implement it in the end.

## Extra Credit

### ðŸ’¯ moving async logic to the helper (and optimistic updates)

The helper function may seem like a little bit of an unnecessary abstraction,
but it's especially useful when your reducer handles async state.

In this extra credit, you'll be refactoring things a bit for the reducer to
handle async state. Right now the `<UserSettings />` component is responsible
for managing the async state. Instead, let's move that logic to the
`userReducer` and our `updateUser` helper.

Because this changes the Usage example quite a bit, you can copy/paste this code
for the `<UserSettings />` and `<UserDataDisplay />` components:

```javascript
function UserSettings() {
  // ðŸ¦‰ notice the useUserState returns an object with a user property now!
  const {user, status, error} = useUserState()
  const userDispatch = useUserDispatch()

  const isPending = status === 'pending'
  const isRejected = status === 'rejected'

  const [formState, setFormState] = React.useState(user)

  const isChanged = !dequal(user, formState)

  function handleChange(e) {
    setFormState({...formState, [e.target.name]: e.target.value})
  }

  function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault()
    // ðŸ¦‰ notice that this code no longer does anything but call `updateUser`
    updateUser(userDispatch, user, formState)
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <div style={{marginBottom: 12}}>
        <label style={{display: 'block'}} htmlFor="username">
          Username
        </label>
        <input
          id="username"
          name="username"
          disabled
          readOnly
          value={formState.username}
          style={{width: '100%'}}
        />
      </div>
      <div style={{marginBottom: 12}}>
        <label style={{display: 'block'}} htmlFor="tagline">
          Tagline
        </label>
        <input
          id="tagline"
          name="tagline"
          value={formState.tagline}
          onChange={handleChange}
          style={{width: '100%'}}
        />
      </div>
      <div style={{marginBottom: 12}}>
        <label style={{display: 'block'}} htmlFor="bio">
          Biography
        </label>
        <textarea
          id="bio"
          name="bio"
          value={formState.bio}
          onChange={handleChange}
          style={{width: '100%'}}
        />
      </div>
      <div>
        <button
          type="button"
          onClick={() => {
            setFormState(user)
            // ðŸ¦‰ notice that the reset button calls userDispatch now instead
            // of the asyncDispatch like it did before
            userDispatch({type: 'reset'})
          }}
          disabled={!isChanged || isPending}
        >
          Reset
        </button>
        <button type="submit" disabled={!isChanged && !isRejected}>
          {isPending
            ? '...'
            : isRejected
            ? 'âœ– Try again'
            : isChanged
            ? 'Submit'
            : 'âœ”'}
        </button>
        {isRejected ? (
          <div style={{color: 'red'}}>
            <pre>{error.message}</pre>
          </div>
        ) : null}
      </div>
    </form>
  )
}

function UserDataDisplay() {
  // ðŸ¦‰ here we're destructuring the user from useUserState
  const {user} = useUserState()
  return <pre>{JSON.stringify(user, null, 2)}</pre>
}
```

Now try to make that work just as it had before, only with the async logic in
the `userReducer` and `updateUser` helper.

### ðŸ’¯ avoiding unmount issues

Imagine a scenario where the user clicks "Submit" and then navigates to another
page before the promise resolves. In this case our `UserProvider` component will
unmount, followed by the promise resolution which will call `dispatch` on a
component which has unmounted. This particular scenario is not a big deal
because it doesn't actually do anything, but it does log an annoying message to
the console and it'd be nice to avoid.

For this extra credit, update the `Usage` component to the following code and
try to click "submit" then quickly uncheck the checkbox and see the warning in
the console. Then see if you can fix the problem.

```javascript
function Usage() {
  const [showUserScreen, setShowUserScreen] = React.useState(true)
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        height: 350,
        width: 300,
        backgroundColor: '#ddd',
        borderRadius: 4,
        padding: 10,
      }}
    >
      <label>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={showUserScreen}
          onChange={e => setShowUserScreen(e.target.checked)}
        />{' '}
        show user screen
      </label>
      {showUserScreen ? (
        <UserProvider>
          <UserSettings />
          <UserDataDisplay />
        </UserProvider>
      ) : null}
    </div>
  )
}
```
