# Styling

## üìù Your Notes

Elaborate on your learnings here in `src/exercise/06.md`

## Background

There are two primary ways to style react components

1. Inline styles with the `style` prop
2. Regular CSS with the `className` prop

**About the `style` prop:**

- In HTML you'd pass a string of CSS:

```html
<div style="margin-top: 20px; background-color: blue;"></div>
```

- In React, you'll pass an object of CSS:

```tsx
<div style={{marginTop: 20, backgroundColor: 'blue'}} />
```

Note that in react the `{{` and `}}` is actually a combination of a JSX
expression and an object expression. The same example above could be written
like so:

```tsx
const myStyles = {marginTop: 20, backgroundColor: 'blue'}
<div style={myStyles} />
```

Note also that the property names are `camelCased` rather than `kebab-cased`.
This matches the `style` property of DOM nodes (which is a
[`CSSStyleDeclaration`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSStyleDeclaration)
object).

**About the `className` prop:**

As we discussed earlier, in HTML, you apply a class name to an element with the
`class` attribute. In JSX, you use the `className` prop.

### Styling abstractions in React

Styling in React has always been a hot topic for abstractions. There have been
many different approaches that people enjoy. Over the years, I've used regular
CSS stylesheets, preprocessors, CSS Modules, and until recently, I used
CSS-in-JS. In fact, I was the author of the most downloaded library for this for
a while
([learn more about it here](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/favor-progress-over-pride-in-open-source)).

Now, my favorite abstraction is the utility-first CSS framework:
[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It's brilliant and covers almost all my
styling needs.

Whatever approach you end up preferring yourself, you'll need to understand the
`className` and `style` props. So that's what this exercise is geared to teach
you.

## Exercise

Production deploys:

- [Exercise](http://react-fundamentals-next.netlify.app/isolated/exercise/06.tsx)
- [Final](http://react-fundamentals-next.netlify.app/isolated/final/06.tsx)

In this exercise we'll use both methods for styling react components.

We have the following css on the page:

```css
.box {
  border: 1px solid #333;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  text-align: center;
}
.box--large {
  width: 270px;
  height: 270px;
}
.box--medium {
  width: 180px;
  height: 180px;
}
.box--small {
  width: 90px;
  height: 90px;
}
```

Note: the class name convention we're following here is called
[BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/).

You can find this in `src/box-styles.css`. You'll observe there's an import for
this file at the top of the page. Webpack (the tool we're running for this
workshop) is responsible for getting that stylesheet onto the page for us.

Your job is to apply the right `className` and `style` props to the divs below
so the styles applied match the text content.

## Extra Credit

### 1. üíØ Create a custom component

[Production deploy](http://react-fundamentals-next.netlify.app/isolated/final/06.extra-1.tsx)

Try to make a custom `<Box />` component that renders a div, accepts all the
props and merges the given `style` and `className` props with the shared values.

I should be able to use it like so:

```tsx
<Box className="box--small" style={{backgroundColor: 'lightblue'}}>
  small lightblue box
</Box>
```

The `box` className and `fontStyle: 'italic'` style should be applied in
addition to the values that come from props.

How you go about implementing it is part of the fun (aka "learning" üòâ). You may
come up with something completely different from how I do it and that's great
for your learning. When you're done, these two ultimately render _exactly_ the
same thing:

```tsx
// before:
<div
  className="box box--small"
  style={{fontStyle: 'italic', backgroundColor: 'lightblue'}}
>
  small lightblue box
</div>

// after:
<Box className="box--small" style={{backgroundColor: 'lightblue'}}>
  small lightblue box
</Box>
```

And I should be able to switch the `div` for a `Box` for the medium and large
boxes as well.

üí∞ Here's a quick tip for the TypeScript part of this. When you want to wrap an
element to basically simulate that element + a little functionality (like in our
case), you'll want to borrow the type definition for that element from React.
Here's how you do that (for a `span` element rather than `div`):

```tsx
function MySpan(props: React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLSpanElement>) {
  return <span {...props} />
}
```

And now you'll get type safety and autocomplete for all the HTML attributes
accepted by a span element.

üí∞ Note, you'll need to import `React` to reference it's `HTMLAttributes`
generic type. To import React, you can use `import * as React from 'react'` at
the top of the file.

### 2. üíØ accept a size prop to encapsulate styling

[Production deploy](http://react-fundamentals-next.netlify.app/isolated/final/06.extra-2.tsx)

It's great that we're composing the `className`s and `style`s properly, but
wouldn't it be better if the users of our components didn't have to worry about
which class name to apply for a given effect? Or that a class name is involved
at all? I think it would be better if users of our component had a `size` prop
and our component took care of making the box that size.

In this extra credit, try to make this API work:

```tsx
<Box size="small" style={{backgroundColor: 'lightblue'}}>
  small lightblue box
</Box>
```

<<<<<<< HEAD Wouldn't it be even cooler if instead of showing an error message
we just didn't allow the user to enter invalid input? Yeah! In this extra credit
I've backed us up and removed the error stuff and now we're going to control the
input state and control the input value. Anytime there's a change we'll call
`.toLowerCase()` on the value to ensure that it's always the lower case version
of what the user types. =======
