# Basic Forms

## Background

In React, there actually aren't a ton of things you have to learn to interact
with forms beyond what you can do with regular DOM APIs and JavaScript. Which I
think is pretty awesome.

You can attach a submit handler to a form element with the `onSubmit` prop. This
will be called with the submit event which has a `target`. That `target` is a
reference to the `<form>` DOM node which has a reference to the elements of the
form which can be used to get the values out of the form!

## Exercise

ðŸ¦‰ There are several ways to get the value of the name input:

- Via their index: `event.target.elements[0]`
- Via the elements object by their `name` or `id` attribute:
  `event.target.elements.usernameInput.value`
- There's another that I'll save for the extra credit

## Extra Credit

### ðŸ’¯ using refs

Another way to get the value is via a `ref` in React. A `ref` is an object that
stays consistent between renders of your React component. It has a `current`
property on it which can be updated to any value at any time. In the case of
interacting with DOM nodes, you can pass a `ref` to a React element and React
will set the `current` property to the DOM node that's rendered.

So if you create an `inputRef` object via `React.useRef`, you could access the
value via: `inputRef.current.value`

Try to get the usernameInput's value using a ref.
