# Narrow Types

Our `CalculatorProps['operator']` type being set simply to `string` is not
"narrow" enough to help users of our `Calculator` component. It allows _any_
`string` value to be provided, even one which our Calculator doesn't support.
For example, the exponentiation operator `**` could be passed and TypeScript
won't complain, but this would cause a runtime error because we don't have a
function to handle that operator:

```tsx
element = <Calculator left={2} operator="**" right={3} /> // ðŸ’¥
```

On top of that, the API for our `Calculator` isn't very discoverable. How would
people know which `operations` are possible? Docs? Trial and error?

Rather than a `string`, your TypeScript type definition can be set to a specific
string. For example:

```tsx
type KodyString = 'Kody'
let kody: KodyString // this variable can only ever be set to the string 'Kody'
```

Combine that functionality with
[union syntax of `|`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#union-types)
and you'll be able to specify exactly which operators are allowed. For example:

```tsx
type KodyOrHannahString = 'Kody' | 'Hannah'
let assistant: KodyOrHannahString // this variable can only ever be set to the string 'Kody' or 'Hannah'

// ðŸ’° tip: we could do the same thing without creating a type by inlining instead:
// let assistant: 'Kody' | 'Hannah'
```

How about we narrow our `operator` type from a `string` to some specific strings
using a union.
