# Derive Types

You may have noticed that we're duplicating our operators of `+`, `-`, `*`, and
`/`. Any time we want to add a new operator, we have to add it in two places and
if we miss one then we could either have a runtime error, or users won't be able
to use our new operator at all.

It would be better if we could have the compiler let us know we missed one
(foreshadowing... look forward to that in an upcoming extra credit) or just
derive the possible operators.

To do this, you need to know about two TypeScript keywords: `typeof` and
`keyof`. Technically `typeof` is a JavaScript feature, but TypeScript builds on
top of this and will get you the TypeScript type for the given variable. So if
you say:

```tsx
const user = { name: 'kody', isCute: true }
type User = typeof user
// type User = { name: string; isCute: boolean; }
```

And then you can use `keyof` to get a union-ed type of strings of all the keys
in a given type:

```tsx
type UserKeys = keyof User
// type UserKeys = "name" | "isCute"
```

[`typeof` operator](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/typeof-types.html)
and
[`keyof` operator](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/keyof-types.html).

With that, try and derive the type of the `CalculatorProps['operator']` so you
don't have to repeat yourself.
