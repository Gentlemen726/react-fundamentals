# Custom Components

Just like in regular JavaScript, when you want to reuse code, you write
functions. If you want to share JSX, you can do that as well. In React we call
these functions "components" and they have some special properties.

Components are functions which accept an object called "props" and return
something that is renderable (more React elements, strings, `null`, numbers,
etc.). To be clear, this is _the_ definition of a React component. That's all it
is. So I'll say it again:
