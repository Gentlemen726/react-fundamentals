# JSX Components

👨‍💼 Great job! We can now use JSX to write custom components and reuse bits of
our UI with ease.

🦉 The children prop is special because it can appear either as a prop or in
between the opening and closing tags of a component. So these two are
equivalent:

```jsx
<Alert>Something went wrong!</Alert>
<Alert children="Something went wrong!" />
```

We'll learn more about that next.
