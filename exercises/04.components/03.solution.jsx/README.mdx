# JSX Components

👨‍💼 Great job! We can now use JSX to write custom components and reuse bits of
our UI with ease.

🦉 The children prop is special because it can appear either as a prop or in
between the opening and closing tags of a component. So these two are
equivalent:

```tsx
<Alert>Something went wrong!</Alert>
<Alert children="Something went wrong!" />
```

Our `Message` component uses the "special" and implicit `children` prop. It's
special because it means we can do this:

```tsx
element = <Message>Hello World</Message>
// is functionally equivalent to:
element = <Message children="Hello World" />
```

And you can put JSX in the children prop with either syntax as well:

```tsx
element = (
	<Message>
		<span>Hello</span> <span>World</span>
	</Message>
)
// is functionally equivalent to:
element = <Message children={[<span>Hello</span>, ' ', <span>World</span>]} />
```

📜 [Learn more about passing JSX as `children`](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#passing-jsx-as-children).

But we don't have to use the `children` prop, we can call it whatever we want.
So you could also do:

```tsx
element = <Message greeting={[<span>Hello</span>, ' ', <span>World</span>]} />
```

The only thing that's special about the `children` prop is that it's implicit
in JSX.

And sometimes using something other than the `children` prop can be really
useful, but we'll get to that in a future workshop.
