# Props

You are the commander of your component's API. The API for your component is
"props" which is the object your component function accepts as an argument. For
example, our `Message` component uses the "special" and implicit `children`
prop. It's special because it means we can do this:

```tsx
element = <Message>Hello World</Message>
// is functionally equivalent to
element = <Message children="Hello World" />

// and this:
element = (
	<Message>
		<span>Hello</span> <span>World</span>
	</Message>
)
// is functionally equivalent to
element = <Message children={[<span>Hello</span>, ' ', <span>World</span>]} />
```

But we don't have to use the `children` prop, we can call it whatever we want.
And sometimes using something other than the `children` prop can be really
useful. For example, let's imagine a `Calculator` component that can display an
equation and it's solution, like so:

```tsx
element = <Calculator left={1} operator="+" right={2} />
// should render:
// <div>
//   <code>
//     1 + 2 = <output>3</output>
//   </code>
// </div>
```

Let's get some more practice with custom components.
