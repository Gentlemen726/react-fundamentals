# Raw API

So far we've only used `React.createElement('someString')`, but the first
argument to `React.createElement` can also be a function which returns something
that's renderable.

So instead of calling your `message` function, pass it as the first argument to
`React.createElement` and pass the `{children: 'Hello World'}` object as the
second argument.
