üë®‚Äçüíº So far we've only used `React.createElement('someString')`, but the first
argument to `React.createElement` can also be a function which returns something
that's renderable.

So instead of calling your `message` function, pass it as the first argument to
`React.createElement` and pass the `{children: 'Hello World'}` object as the
second argument.

```js
React.createElement(
	someFunction,
	{ prop1: 'value1', prop2: 'value2' },
	'child1',
	'child2',
)
```

Then `someFunction` will be called with the props object as the first argument
and the children will appear as an array in the children property of the props
object.

```js
function someFunction(props) {
	props.children // ['child1', 'child2']
	props.prop1 // 'value1'
	props.prop2 // 'value2'
	return // some jsx
}
```
