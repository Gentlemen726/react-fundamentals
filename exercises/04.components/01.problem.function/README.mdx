# Simple Function

👨‍💼 The DOM we want to generate is like this:

```html
<div class="container">
	<div class="message">Hello World</div>
	<div class="message">Goodbye World</div>
</div>
```

In this case, it would be cool if we could reduce the duplication for creating
the React elements for this:

```tsx
<div className="message">{children}</div>
```

So we need to make a function which accepts an object argument with a `children`
property and returns the React element. Then you can interpolate a call to that
function in your JSX.

```tsx
<div>{message('Hello World')}</div>
```

This is not how we write custom React components, but this is important for you
to understand them. We'll get to custom components in the next steps.
