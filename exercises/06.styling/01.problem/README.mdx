# Styling

In this exercise we'll use both methods for styling react components.

We have the following css on the page:

```css
.box {
  border: 1px solid #333;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  text-align: center;
}
.box--large {
  width: 270px;
  height: 270px;
}
.box--medium {
  width: 180px;
  height: 180px;
}
.box--small {
  width: 90px;
  height: 90px;
}
```

Note: the class name convention we're following here is called
[BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/).

You can find this in `s~/shared/box-styles.css`. You'll observe there's an import for
this file at the top of the page. Webpack (the tool we're running for this
workshop) is responsible for getting that stylesheet onto the page for us.

Your job is to apply the right `className` and `style` props to the divs below
so the styles applied match the text content.
