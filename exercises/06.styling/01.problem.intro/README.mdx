# Styling

üë®‚Äçüíº We have the following css on the page:

```css
.box {
	border: 1px solid #333;
	display: flex;
	flex-direction: column;
	justify-content: center;
	text-align: center;
}

.box--large {
	width: 270px;
	height: 270px;
}

.box--medium {
	width: 180px;
	height: 180px;
}

.box--small {
	width: 90px;
	height: 90px;
}
```

Note: the class name convention we're following here is called
[BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/).

The CSS gets onto the page using `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`
tag. In our isolated learning environment, the workshop app gets the styles on
the page for us automatically. In a real-world app, you'll need to add the
`<link>` tag yourself (or use a tool which does this for you).

Your job is to apply the right `className` and `style` props to the divs so the
styles applied match the text content.
