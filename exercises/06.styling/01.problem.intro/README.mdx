# Styling

👨‍💼 We have a CSS file <InlineFile file="index.css" /> that's being loaded on the
page using a link tag:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="index.css" />
```

In our isolated learning environment, the workshop app gets the styles on the
page for us automatically. In a real-world app, you'll need to add the `<link>`
tag yourself (or use a tool which does this for you).

Your job is to apply the right `className` and `style` props to the divs so the
styles applied match the text content.
