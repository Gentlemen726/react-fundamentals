# Accept A Size Prop to Encapsulate Styling

It's great that we're composing the `className`s and `style`s properly, but
wouldn't it be better if the users of our components didn't have to worry about
which class name to apply for a given effect? Or that a class name is involved
at all? I think it would be better if users of our component had a `size` prop
and our component took care of making the box that size.

In this extra credit, try to make this API work:

```tsx
<Box size="small" style={{backgroundColor: 'lightblue'}}>
  small lightblue box
</Box>
```

Wouldn't it be even cooler if instead of showing an error message we just didn't
allow the user to enter invalid input? Yeah! In this extra credit I've backed us
up and removed the error stuff and now we're going to control the input state
and control the input value. Anytime there's a change we'll call
`.toLowerCase()` on the value to ensure that it's always the lower case version
of what the user types.
