# Key prop

We've got a problem. You may have already noticed the error message in the
console about it. Try this:

1. Hit the "remove" button on the last list item
2. Notice that list item is now gone üëç
3. Hit the "remove" button on the first list item
4. Notice that everything's mixed up! üò¶

Let me describe what's going on here.

Here's the TL;DR: Every React element accepts a special `key` prop you can use
to help React keep track of elements between updates. If you don't provide it
when rendering a list, React can get things mixed up. The solution is to give
each element a unique (to the array) `key` prop, and then everything will work
fine.

Let's dive in a little deeper:

If you re-render that list with an added item, React doesn't really know whether
you added an item in the middle, beginning, or end. And the same goes for when
you remove an item (it doesn't know whether that happened in the middle,
beginning, or end either).

To be clear, _we_ know as the developer because we wrote the code, but as far as
React is concerned, we simply gave it some react elements before, we gave it
some after, and now React is trying to compare the before and after with no
knowledge of how the elements got from one position to another.

Sometimes it's not a big deal, because React's best-guess is right and it works
out ok. However, if any of those React elements represent a component that is
maintaining state (like the value of an input or focus state), that can be
pretty problematic, which this exercise demonstrates.

To solve this problem, we need to give React a hint so it can associate the old
React elements with the new ones we're giving it due to the change. We do this
using a special prop called the `key` prop.

In this exercise, we have a list of fruit that appear and can be removed. There
is state that exists (managed by the browser) in the `<input />` for each of the
fruit: the input's `value` (initialized via the `defaultValue` prop).

Without a `key` prop, for all React knows, you removed an input and gave another
label different text content, which leads to the bug we'll see in the exercise.

So here's the rule:

**Whenever you're rendering an array of React elements, each one must have a
unique `key` prop.**

prop in my blog post

That'll give you a bit of what's going on under the hood, so I recommend reading
this!

üë®‚Äçüíº The React elements we're rendering are the `li` elements, so for this
step, add a `key` prop there. You can use the `item.id` for the value to ensure
that the key value is unique for each element.
