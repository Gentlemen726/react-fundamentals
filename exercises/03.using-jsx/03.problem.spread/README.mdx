# Spread props

What if I have an object of props that I want applied to the `div` like this:

```tsx
const children = 'Hello World'
const className = 'container'
const props = { children, className }
const element = <div /> // how do I apply props to this div?
```

If we were doing raw React APIs it would be:

```tsx
const element = React.createElement('div', props)
```

Or, it could be written like this:

```tsx
const element = React.createElement('div', { ...props })
```

See if you can figure out how to make that work with JSX.
