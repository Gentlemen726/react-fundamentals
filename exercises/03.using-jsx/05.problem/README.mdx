# Using React Fragments

One feature of JSX that you'll find useful is called
["React Fragments"](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html). It's a special
kind of component from React which allows you to position two elements
side-by-side rather than just nested.

Let's say we wanted to do the same thing as above, except we didn't want the
`container` `div`. So, we wanted to just create:

```html
<p>Here's Sam's favorite food:</p>
<ul class="sams-food">
  <li>Green eggs</li>
  <li>Ham</li>
</ul>
```

In React, we do this with `<React.Fragment>`. Replace the
`<div className="container">` with a fragment and inspect the DOM to notice that
the elements are both rendered as direct children of `root`.

ðŸ’° TIP: Fragments are common enough that there's a syntax shortcut for them. You
can open with `<>` and close with `</>`, so:

```tsx
element = <React.Fragment>this is in a fragment</React.Fragment>
// is the same as:
element = <>this is in a fragment</>
```

As a little extra part of this, try to figure out why `<React.Fragment>` is
needed at all. Might help if you look at what this looks like using
`React.createElement` rather than JSX. As I said, understanding how JXS compiles
to `React.createElement` really helps improve your capabilities with JSX!
