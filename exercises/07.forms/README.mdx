# Forms

In React, there actually aren't a ton of things you have to learn to interact
with forms beyond what you can do with regular DOM APIs and JavaScript. Which I
think is pretty awesome.

You can attach a submit handler to a form element with the `onSubmit` prop. This
will be called with the submit event which has a `currentTarget`. That
`currentTarget` is a reference to the `<form>` DOM node which has a reference to
the elements of the form which can be used to get the values out of the form!

You can also use this to create an instance of a
[`FormData`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) object
which is the standard object for representing form data in JavaScript.

The interesting thing about forms is that they have been around since the very
beginning of the web when expectations of web applications were a little
different from the expectations of modern applications. Specifically, full-page
refreshes were the norm.

So, when you submit a form, the browser will do a full-page refresh by default.
This is not what we want in a modern application where we want to stay on the
same page and just update the UI (even if we update the URL). It's inefficient
(the browser has to re-process HTML, CSS, and JS with every refresh) and
annoying for users to do a full-page refresh on every navigation and interaction
(imagine if you had a full page refresh when you like post on ùïè!). So we'll be
preventing that behavior using JavaScript and the `onSubmit` event handler on
the form.

```tsx
<form
	onSubmit={event => {
		event.preventDefault() // prevent the default browser behavior
		const formData = new FormData(event.currentTarget)
		// do something with the form data
	}}
>
	{/* form fields go here */}
</form>
```

Form fields also should be labeled appropriately as well to make them accessible
to screen readers and improve the overall user experience as well. There are a
few ways to do this. The easiest being to wrap the input within the label:

```tsx
<label>
	Name
	<input name="name" type="text" />
</label>
```

But often our design requirements don't allow for that. In that case, we can use
the `htmlFor` prop on the label to associate it with the input:

```tsx
<label htmlFor="nameInput">Name</label>
<input id="nameInput" name="name" type="text" />
```

<callout-info class="aside">
	As a reminder, in HTML the attribute is called `for`, but the DOM property is
	`htmlFor` so that's what we use in React's props.
</callout-info>

There are lots of different types of form elements built-into the browser you
can use (of varying degrees of usefulness because of the way they are designed).
[Find a list of standard input types here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input).

There are a number of ways you can be notified of changes to form elements.
We'll not be covering them in this workshop (we'll get into it more in a future
workshop when we talk about managing state), but if you just can't wait, play
around with `onChange` (which behaves like
[the browser's `input` event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/input_event)).
