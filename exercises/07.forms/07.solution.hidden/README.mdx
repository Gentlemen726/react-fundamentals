# Hidden Inputs

👨‍💼 Great! Now when the user submits the form, this extra information will be
available in the submission without the user needing to supply it. Well done!

🦉 A common question here is whether you can supply complex data structures as
hidden input values, and you definitely can. You can either provide multiple
hidden inputs, or just stick JSON in your hidden input like so:

```tsx
<input
	type="hidden"
	name="order"
	value={JSON.stringify({ sandwich: 'tuna' })}
/>
```

Then the backend could parse that JSON from the `order` form field. This can be
very useful if you're using a library that doesn't render form elements, but you
want to send the user's selections to the backend as a part of your form using
your own form elements.
