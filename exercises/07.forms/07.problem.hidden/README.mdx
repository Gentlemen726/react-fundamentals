# Hidden Inputs

👨‍💼 Our backend needs to know what organization to associate this new account to.
We don't need to ask the user this information because we know that it's just
`123`. So we can add
[a hidden input](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/hidden)
to make sure the submission includes this value, but not require the user to
provide it.
