# Checkbox

👨‍💼 We need to add a checkbox for whether the user has already signed a waiver.

For checkboxes, typically they appear on the left side of the label and in this
case we can even have the checkbox be _inside_ the label which means we don't
need to worry about the `for` and `id` attributes which is nice.

Please add the checkbox to the form.

Once you've done that, make sure to submit the form with the checkbox checked
and without it checked so you can familiarize yourself with the difference in
form data because it's kinda funny.
