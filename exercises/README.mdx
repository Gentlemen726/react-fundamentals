# React Fundamentals ⚛

👨‍💼 Hello! I'm Peter the Project Manager and I'm here to help you know what our
users want you to know so you can build the kind of React application they need!
In this workshop we're going to give you the foundational knowledge you need
upon which you can build your React skills.

Our users don't need much at the start of this workshop ("Hello World" is about
as far as we'll get for a bit), but they'll need more as we go along, including
custom components, type safety, styling, forms, error handling, and rendering
lists of data. We'll cover all of that and more in this series of exercises.

It's important that you understand the fundamentals of React so you can not just
use React, but _understand_ it. This will help you build better applications and
be more effective at debugging when things go wrong.

With that, let's get started!
