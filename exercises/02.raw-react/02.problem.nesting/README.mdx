# Nesting Elements

👨‍💼 See if you can figure out how to write the JavaScript + React code to
generate this DOM output:

```html
<ul class="sams-food">
	<li>Green eggs</li>
	<li>Ham</li>
</ul>
```

Hint: you'll be using the `children` prop!

Note also, depending on how you implement this, you may get a warning in the
developer console about needing a "key" prop. We'll get to that later.
