# Deep Nesting Elements

👨‍💼 Let's go a little deeper. Just to make sure we really understand how to nest
this stuff. Try to create this using React's APIs:

```html
<div class="container">
	<p>Here's Sam's favorite food:</p>
	<ul class="sams-food">
		<li>Green eggs</li>
		<li>Ham</li>
	</ul>
</div>
```
