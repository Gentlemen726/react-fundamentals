# Generate the Root Node

Rather than having the `root` node in the HTML, see if you can create that one
using JavaScript as well. Remove the `<div id="root"></div>` from the HTML and
instead of trying to find it with `document.getElementById('root')`, create it
and append it to the `document.body`.
