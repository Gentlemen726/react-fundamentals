# Hello World in JS

It doesn't take long to learn how to make "Hello World" appear on the page with
HTML:

```html
<html>
	<body>
		<div>Hello World</div>
	</body>
</html>
```

The browser takes this HTML code and generates
[the DOM (the Document Object Model)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)
out of it. The browser then exposes the DOM to JavaScript so you can interact
with it to add a layer of interactivity to your web-page.

```html
<html>
	<body>
		<div>Hello World</div>
		<script type="module">
			// your JavaScript here
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
```

Years ago, people were generating HTML on the server and then adding JavaScript
on top of that generated HTML for interactivity. However, as requirements for
that interactivity became more challenging, this approach produced applications
that were difficult to maintain and had performance issues.

So modern JavaScript frameworks were created to address some of the challenges
by programmatically creating the DOM rather than defining it in hand-written
HTML.

```html
<html>
	<body>
		<script type="module">
			const element = document.createElement('div')
			element.textContent = 'Hello World'
			document.body.append(element)
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
```

This approach is more flexible, but comes at the cost of making the browser do
a little extra work. The browser has to parse the JavaScript code, execute it,
and then generate the DOM from the JavaScript code before displaying things to
the user.

This is why hybrid approaches are popular. You can generate the DOM with HTML
and then add interactivity with JavaScript. In the world of React, you can use
React code to generate the HTML on the server and then use the same React code
to add interactivity on the client. Doing this isn't an enormous amount of
effort, however there are a lot of considerations to take into account so you'll
want to use [Remix](https://remix.run) (which is built on top of React) to make
it easier (and you get a lot of other critical pieces to the puzzle as well).

We're going to focus on the client-side of things in this workshop, but you can
apply the same principles to frameworks like Remix. But let's just start with
the total fundamentals of creating and appending our own DOM nodes before we
get into the React side of things.
