# Hello World in JS

👨‍💼 It's important to have a basic understanding of how to generate and interact
with DOM nodes using JavaScript because it will help you understand how React
works under the hood a little better. So in this exercise we're actually not
going to use React at all. Instead we're going to use JavaScript to create a
`div` DOM node with the text "Hello World" and insert that DOM node into the
document.

🐨 We'll be in <InlineFile file="index.html" /> to help guide you through making
this work! See you there!

👨‍💼 Once you're finished, open up the
[browser devtools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools) so
you can check the DOM is what you expect it to be.
