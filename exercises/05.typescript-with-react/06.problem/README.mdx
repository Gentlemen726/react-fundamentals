# Use a “Constrained Identity Function (CIF)”

Ok, so repeating ourselves there is not awesome. The problem is that we want to
enforce the value of our `operations` object, but to do that we either have to
widen the type of our `key` or list it explicitly as we're doing.

What we need is some way to enforce the values of our object, without having to
annotate our object. That's what a CIF is. I've written a blog post to describe
this, so I'll let you go through that, and then try to make that work yourself:
