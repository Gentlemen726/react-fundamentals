# TypeScript with React

In this exercise, we're going to take the `Calculator` component we have in the
extra credit of the previous exercise and add type annotations to it.

We're moving from the `*.html` files to `*.tsx` files. This is more real-world
and also your editor likely supports TypeScript better within TypeScript files
rather than HTML files. From here on out, every exercise will export an `App`
component. The workshop app will take care of rendering that for us. The
workshop app is a little magical, so you probably won't find where it happens,
but rest assured, it's just calling `ReactDOM.render` under the hood, just like
we were doing in the previous exercises.

Moving to `*.tsx` files also means that you can use the tests to help validate
your solution is correct. It's Alfred the Alert's time to shine ðŸš¨!

As a reminder, to get the tests running, in a separate terminal window, run
`npm test`, then open the test file for the exercise you're working on and
update the imports:

```diff
  import {render} from '@testing-library/react'
  import {alfredTip} from '@kentcdodds/react-workshop-app/test-utils'
- import {App} from '../final/05'
- // import {App} from '../exercise/05'
+ // import {App} from '../final/05'
+ import {App} from '../exercise/05'
```

In addition to typing the function itself, we'll also be able to play around
with some approaches to typing the `operations` object to make things easier for
us as well as people using our component.

I'd also like you to meet Lily the Life Jacket! ðŸ¦º She's going to be hanging
around the rest of the crew to indicate wherever there's something that's
TypeScript-specific you need to do and to give you TypeScript-specific tips.
You'll be working with Lily the Life Jacket a lot in this exercise.

Now, open `src/exercise/05.tsx` and follow the emoji there. You'll notice that
instead of calling `ReactDOM.render`, we're exporting an `App` component. This
is how the rest of the workshops will work. Rest assured, `ReactDOM.render` _is_
being called for you under the hood, just like we were doing earlier.
