# Reset

👨‍💼 Great! It's nice to give our users a path forward. One thing you may have
noticed is that if you enter in values into the form and there's an error, when
you restore your form, the values are gone. This is because we're not
persisting the values in the form. That's beyond the scope of this exercise, but
it's something to keep in mind. If that's something important to your situation,
you'll need to find a way to persist the form values and restore those values
when the form is rendered again.
