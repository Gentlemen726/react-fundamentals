# Intro to raw React APIs

Let's convert this to use React! But don't worry, we won't be doing any JSX just
yet... You're going to use raw React APIs here.

In modern applications you'll get React and React DOM files from a "package
registry" like [npm](https://npmjs.com) ([react](https://npm.im/react) and
[react-dom](https://npm.im/react-dom)). But for these first exercises, we'll use
the script files which are available on [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com) and
regular script tags so you don't have to bother installing them. So in the
exercise you'll be required to add script tags for these files.

Once you include the script tags, you'll have two new global variables to use:
`React` and `ReactDOM`.

Here's a simple example of the API:

```typescript
const elementProps = {id: 'element-id', children: 'Hello world!'}
const elementType = 'h1'
const reactElement = React.createElement(elementType, elementProps)
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement)
root.render(reactElement)
```

"Props" is short for "properties" and they're a foundational part of React
elements. You can think of the element type as a blueprint for the kind of React
component to create and the props are the inputs for when React actually creates
that element.

`children` is a special prop. You can pass a single element like above, or an
array of children (if there's more than one). You can also pass the children as
any number of additional arguments:

```typescript
const elementProps = {id: 'element-id'}
const child1 = 'Hello'
const child2 = ' '
const child3 = 'world!'
const elementType = 'h1'
const reactElement = React.createElement(
  elementType,
  elementProps,
  child1,
  child2,
  child3,
)
ReactDOM.render(reactElement, rootElement)
```

Alright! Let's do this!

ðŸ’° Tip: `console.log` the `reactElement` to see what it looks like. You might
find it kinda interesting!
