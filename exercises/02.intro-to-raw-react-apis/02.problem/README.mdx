# Nesting Elements

See if you can figure out how to write the JavaScript + React code to generate
this DOM output:

```html
<ul class="sams-food">
  <li>Green eggs</li>
  <li>Ham</li>
</ul>
```

Note also, depending on how you implement this, you may get a warning in the
developer console about needing a "key" prop. We'll get to that later.
